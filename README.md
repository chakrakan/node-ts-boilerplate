# node-ts-boilerplate

A minimal NodeJS + Typescript + Jest boilerplate to get started with quickly!

Plan on iterating + making it more opinionated based on personal needs.

### Includes

- babel config
- eslint config
- yarn
- testing with jest
- typescript config for base, eslint, test
- gitignore for nodejs
- husky + pretty quick for pre-commit hook
- circleci pipeline to install deps, build, and run tests
